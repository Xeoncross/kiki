Have you ever wanted...

- to use something Facebook without an internet connection?
- to use Facebook without advertisements and surveillance?
- to use Facebook and keep all your data, all the time?

KiKi is an attempt to address problems like these, and many more.

KiKi is in its early days, but the plan is for you to use a social network—even when you are offline—in a safe, secure,
and sharable way that makes it easy to discover new friends and connect with current ones.

If you'd like to help us make that vision a reality, we'd love to have you try
out KiKi.

KiKi is an [open-source project](https://github.com/schollz/KiKi) that
comprises two main design elements:

1. a set of protocols for enabling secure, distributed sharing of privacy-leveled information
2. reference implementations of viewer that demonstrates the capabilities

Using these elements as building blocks, KiKi provides a place
for all your social data and gives the power back to you to have precise control of your social information.

To get started, [**install the KiKi client**](/install)
